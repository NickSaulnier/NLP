# Project - Neural Metaphor Identification with BiLSTMs and GloVe Embeddings

## How to Run the NeuralMetaphorDetection.ipynb file

The notebook needs the glove.800B.300d.txt file to run. This file is ~5gb large and can be downloaded at https://nlp.stanford.edu/projects/glove/.

The only other input file is the VUA_formatted.csv containing the training and testing data. This file should be automatically loaded by the notebook if it is in the root project directory. I wrote the notebook using COLAB, but hopefully that won't cause any issues--my google drive was conditionally loaded. 

That is all. Thanks!
